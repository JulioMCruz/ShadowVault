# ShadowVault - Project Analysis (Planner Mode)

## Background and Motivation

ShadowVault is a **Web3 Password Manager with Zero-Knowledge Verification** developed as an MVP for an ETH Global hackathon. The project aims to eliminate the need for centralized custody and allows users to prove password security policy compliance without revealing their secrets.

**Current Objective**: Analyze and understand the current state of the ShadowVaultApp project, which currently only integrates Privy for authentication.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current State of ShadowVaultApp Project

After analyzing the project, I have identified the following:

#### 1. **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Privy (@privy-io/react-auth v1.82.4)
- **Web3 Integration**: Wagmi v2.12.2 and Viem v2.21.1
- **Blockchain**: Configured for Zircuit Garfield Testnet
- **State Management**: React Context with QueryClient for caching

#### 2. **Implemented Features**
- ‚úÖ **Privy Authentication**: Login/logout with email, SMS, and wallet
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Interface**: Complete dashboard with simulated data
- ‚úÖ **Routing**: Page structure (vault, security, analytics, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Complete UI**: Modern and responsive UI components
- ‚úÖ **Mock Data**: Simulation of activity, security scores, networks

#### 3. **Missing Features (Project Core)**

- ‚ùå **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: No integration with Noir
- ‚ùå **Base SQL Storage**: No connection to Base for storing ciphertext
- ‚ùå **Smart Contracts**: No deployment to Zircuit for verification
- ‚ùå **Hyperlane Bridge**: No implementation of cross-chain messaging
- ‚ùå **Real Password Management**: Only UI mockup

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current State**: The ShadowVaultApp project has an **excellent UI/UX and authentication foundation**, but lacks all the **core Web3 password manager logic**. It's essentially a complete frontend with simulated data.

**Components Ready for Integration**:
- ‚úÖ Privy authentication flow
- ‚úÖ Dashboard with placeholders for real data
- ‚úÖ UI components for vault management
- ‚úÖ Network status monitoring UI
- ‚úÖ Security score display

**Critical Next Steps**:
1. Enable `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_CRYPTO=true` in `.env.local` to use `/debug/crypto`
2. Visit `/debug/crypto` (logged in with Privy) ‚Üí click "Derive Encryption Key" to log private key (preview) and show derived key (base64)
3. If `exportPrivateKey` is not available in your Privy plan/policy, switch to using `useWallets()` from Privy SDK to locate the embedded wallet instance
4. After validation, remove debug flag to avoid exposing secrets in dev

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### To Proceed with Implementation

**Need User Clarification**:
1. **Implementation Priority**: Which component do you want to implement first?
   - Local encryption (easier, immediate feedback)
   - Smart contracts (more complex, requires backend)
   - Base SQL integration (requires infrastructure)

2. **Work Scope**: Do you want to:
   - Only implement a specific functionality?
   - Work towards complete MVP?
   - Focus on functional demo for hackathon?

3. **Architecture Preferences**: 
   - Do you prefer keeping everything in frontend (client-side crypto)?
   - Or do you need backend for proof generation?

Additionally:
- Confirm it's okay to temporarily export the embedded wallet private key for DEV to validate derivation. This is guarded by `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_CRYPTO` and should never ship to production.

## Lessons

### Project Observations
- The project has very good frontend architecture with Next.js and Privy
- The documentation in README.md is excellent and very detailed
- Current code is mainly UI mockup, but well structured
- Missing all core cryptographic implementation
- Zircuit integration is configured but not used

### Key Technologies Identified
- Privy for Web3 authentication
- Wagmi/Viem for blockchain interactions
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Radix UI + Tailwind for UI
- Needs: Noir, Base SQL, Hyperlane, WebCrypto API

---

**Analysis Conclusion**: ShadowVaultApp is a very polished frontend with working Privy authentication, but needs all the core Web3 password manager functionality implementation according to the main README specification.
